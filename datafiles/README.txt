Dear Hacker, 
I want you to know: If you are reading this, you ain't so bad.
You penetrated the game files. I mean idk why would you do this...
But still, if you wanna have some fun, change anything in your local savefiles.
The only thing I ask you not to do is breaking the game server.
Please, don't spoil the experience for other players. I believe you ain't a bad person.
The only thing you get when hacking the server is my headache.
I mean, you can do it anyway, you actually will if you hate me, the programmer
and the whole developer team. But the only thing I can do with it is asking you to change your mind.
<3

P.s. if anyone is actually reeading this, please contact me on Telegram (@PepegaPh0ne)
